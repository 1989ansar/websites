Designing a module</h2></div></div><p>
	Modules in Python are a nice construct to put definitions
	together in a single file that you will be able to reuse at
	any time alter on. In order to get a good module it's a good
	idea to follow some principles and to think about it before.
      </p><div class="example"><p class="title"><b>Example 14.3. A genealogy module</b></p><p>
	    As an example, we want to design a module to process
	    genealogical trees (pedigrees). This module should provide
	    functions to build the tree and to create individuals, to
	    register marriages and births. So first we must list the
	    necessary operations or functions. This list should be as
	    <span class="emphasis"><em>abstract</em></span> as possible. This means that at this stage, you
	    don't need to specify the way it will be programmed.  
	  </p><p>
	    Let' start by listing the operations that we need to
	    construct the tree and idividuals.
	    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
		Create person: this will produces a data structure
		containing the information related to an individual:
		his/her name, gender, spouse, parents and children. 
	      </li><li>
		Register a marriage: after checking that the persons
		are not already married, this will update the
		information about their respective spouse.
	      </li><li>
		Register a birth: this will create the child as a
		person and update information in the father's and
		mother's data structures about their children. 
	      </li><li>
		Create a family: this creates a list of persons
		together with their descendants. 
	      </li></ul></div><p>
	  </p><p>
	    Now we need operations to query and display our tree.
	    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
		 Search for a person given his/her name.
	      </li><li>
		 Check whether a person is a family member.
	      </li><li>
		 Test whether two persons are identical. Our module
		 is illustrative and basic, so we will define the
		 identity by the fact that two persons have the same
		 name. 
	      </li><li>
		Get the list of grandsons, granddaughters,
		grandparents, brothers, sisters,...
	      </li><li>
		Display the data related to a person (name, gender, spouse,
		parents and children).
	      </li><li>
		Display a family (a list of individuals).
	      </li><li>
		Get the names of the members of a family.
	      </li></ul></div><p>
	  </p><p>
	    We can start to build our module. We do not need to
	    write code; we will just define the functions and
	    their parameters, and add a docstring to these
	    definitions. Each definition will just contain a
	    single <b>pass</b> statement in order to have
	    an executable file, that can be used for instance by
	    the <b>pydoc</b> to display the whole
	    documentation of the module. A header docstring will
	    contain the general description of the module.
