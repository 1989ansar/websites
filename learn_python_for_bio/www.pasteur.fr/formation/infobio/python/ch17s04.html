Parsing</h2></div></div><p>
	  In Bioinformatics, parsing is very important, since it enables to
    extract informations from data files or to extract results
    produced by various analysis programs, and to make 
    them available in your programs. For instance, a Blast parser will
    transform a text output into a list of hits and their alignment,
    that can be made available as a data structure, such as, for example,
    Biopython <tt>Bio.Blast.Record</tt> objects, that you
    can use in a Python program.
    </p><p>
    The purpose of this section is not to present everything about
    parsing, but just to introduce some basic notions.
    </p><p>
      Parsing means analyzing a text and producing structured data in
      a form that is useful for programs. It can be a list of
      strings, a set of classes instances, or just a boolean result:
      this depends on the needs and the parsing system you are using.
      An important aspect of parsing is the architecture that is used
      to process the text that you want to analyze. 

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
      Parsing can be done by just reading a file or a stream line by
      line, and by looking for the occurrence(s) of a word, or a
      pattern. In <a href="ch17s04.html#fig_parsing_manual" title="Figure 17.1. Manual parsing">Figure 17.1</a>, lines are
      searched for a header pattern, or a hit pattern, and processed
      accordingly. 

	  </p><div class="figure"><a name="fig_parsing_manual"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 17.1. Manual parsing</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/parsing_manual.png"></div></div><p>

      </p></li><li><p>

      You can tell an external component which set of words you are
      interested in, by providing a description of set of words to be
      found. You then feed this component a document to parse, and
      wait him to tell you when these words are found as well as
      sending you the occurrences. This      kind of system 
      is said to be <span class="emphasis"><em>event-driven</em></span>, and XML
      provides tools for such type of parsing.

	  </p><div class="figure"><a name="fig_parsing_event"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 17.2. Event-based parsing</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/parsing_event.png"></div></div><p>
      </p></li><li><p>
      You can describe the whole document by set of hierarchical
      subparts, and associate to each sub-part actions to be
      automatically executed by a parsing engine. <a href="ch17s04.html#fig_parsing_deco_grammar" title="Figure 17.3. Parsing: decorated grammar">Figure 17.3</a>
      shows such a system to parse a Blast report. A Blast report is
      described as a header followed by a list of hits. A hit is
      described as a score and a list of HSP, and a HSP is described as a
      score and a list of alignments.  You define
      these subparts by a set of 
      <span class="emphasis"><em>rules</em></span>, sometimes using patterns, in what is
      usually called a <span class="emphasis"><em>grammar</em></span>, or even a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>decorated</em></span> grammar, since you decorate each
      sub-part with an associated action. The
      <tt>lex</tt> and <tt>yacc</tt> system is
      such a parsing engine.

	  </p><div class="figure"><a name="fig_parsing_deco_grammar"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 17.3. Parsing: decorated grammar</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/parsing_deco_grammar.png"></div></div><p>
      </p></li><li><p>
      You can have a parsing engine process your data according to a
      grammar, and returns a hierarchical data structure in a form
      that your program can understand (for instance, in Python, as a
      set of objects). The XML/DOM engine behaves like this.

	  </p><div class="figure"><a name="fig_parsing_doc"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 17.4. Parsing result as a hierarchical document</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/parsing_doc.png"></div></div><p>

      </p></li></ul></div><p>

      So, in all the cases, there is an engine driving the whole
      process, be it a simple loop or a specialized component.

      In this chapter, we will just do some "manual" parsing with
      patterns that are introduced in <a href="ch17s05.html" title="17.5. Searching for patterns.">Section 17.5</a>, as well as  some
      event-driven parsing will be done as a 
      practical work on abstract frameworks (see <a href="ch19s04.html#exo_abstract_fmk_enz" title="Exercise 19.4. Example of an abstract framework:&#xA;			Enzyme parser">Exercise 19.4</a>), and during the Web/XML
      course.
