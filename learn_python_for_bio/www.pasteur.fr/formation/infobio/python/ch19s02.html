	The topics introduced in this section address some of the issues of
	software quality, and how Python can help on this matter. 
      </p><p>
      Before
	entering into details, let us just summarize some important
	concepts (you can find a good and more exhaustive description in
	[Meyer97]). 
 	There is no absolute quality in software: depending on the
	context, scale, scope and goals of the program being developped,
    you might very well either write on-the-fly short pieces of code
    to solve a temporary problem, or spend a significant effort to have
    your application follow an industrial design process.
    So, rather than only a global so-called standard that should be applied
    for each program you write, there are a few <span class="emphasis"><em>quality
    factors</em></span> to be evaluated according to the actual needs
    of the project. Among
    these factors, one usually distinguish between internal and external
    factors. <span class="emphasis"><em>External</em></span> quality factors are the
    ones that corresponds to visible requirements, directly important
    for the user of the software, such as <span class="bold"><b>validity</b></span>, <span class="bold"><b>robustness</b></span> or <span class="bold"><b>efficiency</b></span>. <span class="emphasis"><em>Internal</em></span>
    quality factors are properties of the code itself, such as
    legibility or modularity. In fact, internal factors often
    indirectly help to get external quality. Some factors, such as
    <span class="bold"><b>reusability</b></span>, <span class="bold"><b>extensibility</b></span> and <span class="bold"><b>compatibility</b></span>, 
    that we will study more thoroughly here, belong to external quality
    factors in the sense that they can be required by the users of a
    software library or the programmers of a shared source code; they
    are also important internal quality factors in the sense that they
    make the internal quality of the source code better.
    The aim of this chapter is mainly to describe these factors, as
    well as internal quality factors.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8763"></a>19.2.2. Large scale programming</h3></div></div><p>
	Theoretically, in order to get a program that performs a given
    task and solves the problem you have specified, a basic set of
    instructions such as: branching, repetitions, expressions and data
    structures can be sufficient. Now, the programs that you produce
    can become a problem by themselves, for several reasons:

	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>They can become very large, resulting in
	    thousand lines of code where it is becoming difficult to
	    make even a slight change
	    (<span class="emphasis"><em>extensibility</em></span> problem). 
	  </li><li>When an application is developped within a team, it
	    is important for different people to be able to share the
	    code and combine parts developped by different people
	    (<span class="emphasis"><em>compatibility</em></span>) ; having big and
	    complex source files can become a problem.
	  </li><li>During your programmer's life, or within a team,
	    you will very often have
	    to re-use the same kind of instructions set: searching for
	    an item in a collection, organizing a hierarchical
	    data structure, converting data formats, ...; moreover,
	    such typical blocks of code have certainly already been
	    done elsewhere
	    (<span class="emphasis"><em>reusability</em></span>). Generally, source code
	    not well designed for re-use can thus be a problem.
	  </li></ul></div><p>

	  So, depending on the context of the project, there are some
	  issues which are just related to the <span class="emphasis"><em>management of
	  source code</em></span> by humans, as opposed to the
	  specification of the task to perform. And if you think about
	  it, you probably tend to use variable names that are
	  relevant to your data and problem, aren't you? So, why? This is
	  probably not for the computer, but, of course, rather for
	  the human reader.  

	  So, in  order to handle source structure and management issues,
	  several conceptual and technical solutions have been
	  designed in modern programming languages. This is the topic
	  of this chapter.

      </p><p>
    Let us say that we have to develop source code for a big
    application and that we want this source code to be spread and
    shared among several team members, to be easy to maintain and evolve
    (extensible), and to be useful outside of the project for other
    people (reusable). What are the properties a source code should 
    have for these purpose? 
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>it should be divided in small manageable chunks</li><li>these chunks should be logically divided</li><li>they should be easy to understand and use</li><li>they should be as independant as possible: you should
	    not have to use chunk A each time you need to use chunk B</li><li>they should have a clear <span class="emphasis"><em>interface</em></span>
	    defining what they can do</li></ul></div><p>

    The most important concept to obtain these properties is called
    <span class="emphasis"><em>modularity</em></span>, or how to build modular software
    <span class="emphasis"><em>components</em></span>. The general idea related to
    software components is that an application program can be built by
    combining small logical building blocks.  In this approach, as
    shown in figure <a href="ch19s02.html#fig_comp_lang" title="Figure 19.1. Components as a language">Figure 19.1</a>, building blocks form a kind of high-level
    language.
	
	</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig_comp_lang"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 19.1. Components as a language</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/comp_lang.png"></div></div><p>
	
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8822"></a>19.2.3. Modularity</h3></div></div><p>
	  The simplest form of modularity is actually something that
	you already know: writing a function to encapsulate a block of
	statements within a logical unit, with some form of
	generalization, or abstraction, through the definition of some
	parameters. But there are more general and elaborated forms of
	components, namely: modules and packages.
      </p><p>
	  So, what is modularity? As developped in
	[Meyer97], modularity is 
	again not a general single property, but is rather
	described by a few principles:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><span class="bold"><b>A few interfaces</b></span>: a
	      component must communicate with as 
	      few other components as possible. The graph of
	      dependencies between components should be rather loosely
	      coupled. 
	  </li><li><span class="bold"><b>Small interfaces</b></span>:
	      whenever two components communicate, there should
	      be as few communication as possible between them.
	  </li><li><span class="bold"><b>Explicit interfaces</b></span>:
	      interfaces should be explicit. Indirect
	      coupling, in particular through shared variables, should
	      be made explicitly public.
	  </li><li><span class="bold"><b>Information hiding</b></span>:
	      information in a component should 
	      generally remain private, except for elements explicitly
	      belonging to the interface. This means that it should not
	      be necessary to use non public attributes elements of a
	      component in order to use it. In languages such as
	      Python, as we will see later, it is technically
	      difficult to hide a component's attributes. So, some care
	      must be taken in order to <span class="emphasis"><em>document</em></span>
	      public and private attributes. 
	  </li><li><span class="bold"><b>Syntactic units</b></span>:
	      Components must correspond to syntactic units of the 
	      language. In Python, this means that components should
	      correspond to known elements such as modules, packages,
	      classes, or functions that you use in Python statements:
	    <pre class="programlisting">
import dna
from Bio.Seq import Seq
	    </pre><tt>dna</tt>, <tt>Bio</tt>,
	      <tt>Bio.Seq</tt> and
	      <tt>Seq</tt> are syntactic units, not only
	      files, directories or block of statements. In fact,
	      Python really helps in defining components: almost
	      everything that you define in a module is a syntactic unit.
      </li></ul></div><p>

	  You can view this approach as though not only the user of the
	  application would be taken into account, but also the
	  programmer, as the user of an intermediate level
	  product. This is why there is a need for
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>interfaces design</em></span> 
	  also at the component level.

      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8874"></a>19.2.4. Methodology</h3></div></div><p>
	These properties may be easier to obtain by choosing an
	appropriate design methodogy. A	design methodoly should indeed: 
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
	      help in defining components by successive
	      <span class="emphasis"><em>decomposition</em></span>; 
	  </li><li>
	      help in defining components that are easy to
	      <span class="emphasis"><em>combine</em></span>; 
	  </li><li>
	      help in designing
	      <span class="emphasis"><em>self-understandable</em></span> components: a
	      programmer should be able to understand how to use a
	      component by looking only at this component;
	  </li><li>
	      help in defining <span class="emphasis"><em>extensible</em></span> components;
	      the more independant components are, the more they are
	      easy to evolve; for instance, components sharing an
	      internal data structure representation are difficult to
	      change, because you have to modify all of them whenever
	      you change the data structure.
	  </li></ul></div><p>
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sect_comp_reuse"></a>19.2.5. Reusability</h3></div></div><p>
	  Programming is by definition a very repetitive task, and
	programmers have dreamed a lot of being able to pick
	off-the-shelves general purpose 
	components, relieving them from this burden of programming the
	same code again and again. 

	  However, this objective has, by far, not really been reached
	so far. There
	are several both non technical and technical reasons for
	this. Non-technical reasons encompass organisational and
	psychological obstacles: although this has probably been
	reduced	by the wide access to the Web, being aware of existing
	software, taking the time to learn it, and accepting to use
	something you don't have built yourself are common
	difficulties in reusing components. 

	  On the technical side, there are some conditions for modules
	  to be reusable.

	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><span class="emphasis"><em>Flexibility</em></span>:
	      One of the main difficulty for making
	reusable components lies in the fact that, while having the
	impression that you are again programming the same stereotyped
	code, one does not really repeat exactly the same code.
	 There are indeed slight variations that
	typically concern to following aspects (for instance, in a
	standard table lookup):
	  
	    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
	      types: the exact data type being used may vary: the
	      table might contain integers, strings, ...
	      </li><li>
	      data structures and algorithms may vary: the table might
	      be implemented with an array, a dictionary, a binary
	      search tree, ... ; the comparison function in the sort
	      procedure may also vary according to the type of the
	      items. 
	      </li></ul></div>

	So, as you can understand from these remarks, the more
	<span class="emphasis"><em>flexible</em></span> the component is, the more
	  reusable it is. Flexibility can be partly obtained by
	  modularity, as long as modules are well designed.
	  However, in order to get real flexibility, other techniques
	  are required, such as genericity, polymorphism, or
	  inheritance, that are described in <a href="ch19s05.html" title="19.5. Flexibility">Section 19.5</a>.  

      </li><li><span class="emphasis"><em>Independancy towards the internal
	    representation</em></span>: by providing a interface that
	    does not imply any specific internal data structure, the
	    module can be used more safely. The client program will be
	    able to use the same interface, even if the internal
	    representation is modified.
	  </li><li><span class="emphasis"><em>Group of related objects</em></span>: it is
	  easier to use components when all objects that should be
	  used together (the data structures, data and algorithms) are
	  actually grouped in the same component. 
	  </li><li><span class="emphasis"><em>Common features</em></span>: common
	  features or similar templates among different modules should
	  be made shareable, thus making the whole set of modules more
	  consistent. 

	</li></ol></div><p>
