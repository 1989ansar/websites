<h2>About... Account Recovery</h2>
<h3>I have forgotten my password, what do I do?</h3>
<p>The Project Euler server database no longer stores any personal information which can be used to prove a particular account belongs to you. So if you registered after the 14 August and have forgotten your password then unfortunately there is nothing that can be done to recover your account.</p>
<p>However, if you registered before this date then in the first instance we recommend that you do your best to try to remember the password yourself. If that fails, then for a limited period, and depending on the volume of requests, we are offering a manual process which will allow passwords to be reset for <u>members who have solved 100+ problems AND have not been able to sign in to the new website</u>.</p>
<br  />
<h3>I have solved 100+ problems, what next?</h3>
<p>If you qualify then send an email to knock_knock@projecteuler.net, use the subject &quot;PE Account Recovery&quot;, and in the body of the email place your username on the first line and the email address that was previously stored in the database on the second line. As explained, this process will be handled manually, one at a time, so it may take some time for a reply.</p>
<br />
<h3>If you no longer store email addresses in the database then how can you confirm that the email address provided is authentic?</h3>
<p>The email you send will go to one member of the team (euler) who will compare the address you provide in the body of the email with an archive of the Project Euler database which is located only on his local machine.</p>
<br />
<h3>I have not solved 100+ problems, what about me?</h3>
<p>If the number of requests proves to be manageable then there is a possibility that the threshold will be reduced from 100. Any changes will be updated in the news feed and on the forum. However, if the number of requests are too great and/or your solve count is much lower then we may never reach your threshold, so you may wish to create a new account. We apologise for this.</p></div>
