    	<description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/static/images/windows-development-with-cygwin.png&#34; class=&#34;gallery&#34; title=&#34;Cygwin&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/windows-development-with-cygwin-small.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Windows has long been considered a subpar platform for web development not based on a Microsoft technology, or in more general terms, for any kind of open source work. If you are looking for tutorials online on any open source related topic and happen to be on a Windows PC, you are going to have a lot of trouble in finding material that does not assume you are on a Linux or Mac system with access to Unix-based tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mostly work on a Mac computer these days, but I own and regularly use a Windows PC as well. In this article I&#39;m going to introduce you to the open source project that I use to bridge the gap between Windows and the Unix world. This project allows me to work on my open source projects on the PC, using the same tools I use on the Mac, or on a Linux PC. The image above is a screenshot of my terminal, running on Windows 10 (click on it to see it in its actual dimensions). There you can see I have three independent very Unixy-looking console sessions. Not the type of terminal window you associate with Windows, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
