		<description><![CDATA[Shaun, can&#039;t believe I missed this when you posted it, couldn&#039;t have put it much better myself. I agree that the risk factor for link building has increased massively and can be annoying when sites till ranks for poor articles, trackback hacking etc. I have seen that sites with far less quality links now seem to be ranking far better, but some of the serps these days are just poor, there clean up efforts are leaving some pages with 3,4,5 results from the same site, good if its one of yours, not so good if its not :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ηι Shaun,
A large News Media Group has, a News Vortal ,3 magazines (for kids,health,fashion) and one Newspaper.
All those different mediums have their content in independent websites (since the branding of all 6 Medium is very strong).
My question is how to crosslink them editorially for SEO purposes?
Is it OK if i put a news box at every magazine site?
Do links from unrelated sites dilute your rankings for your key phrases ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Shaun.

No haven&#039;t been doing any link building since the hit nearly a year ago, kind of become a bit disillusioned with chasing the algorithm and focused what little time we have on advertising our properties on 3rd party MLS sites that have good rankings as well as doing a bit of PPC.

I dont really have time to be too creative in terms of building good quality links, we have been writing some content for the blog but that doesn&#039;t seem to generate much interest or natural links.

I figure the homepage must be under some kind of algorithmic filter as when I search on Google UK for the keywords &quot;Hua Hin Property&quot; you will find our blog page on the 3rd page http://www.thailand-property.biz/blog/category/general_property_news_hua_hin/ and the homepage nowwhere to be seen.

Thanks for the input.

Regards
