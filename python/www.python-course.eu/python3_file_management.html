<h2>File Management</h2>
<br>
<h3>Files in General</h3>
<p>
<br>
<img class="imgright" src="images/files2.png" alt="Files" />
It's hard to find anyone in the 21st Century, who doesn't know what a file is. 
If we say file, we mean of course, a file on a computer. There may be people 
who don't know anymore the "container", like a cabinet or a folder, for keeping 
papers archived in a convenient order. A file on a computer is the modern counterpart
of this. It is a collection of information, which can be accessed and used by a computer program. Usually,
a file resides on a durable storage. Durable means that the data is persistent, 
i.e. it can be used by other programs after the program which has created or manipulated it
has terminated. 
<br><br>
The term file management in the context of computers refers to the manipulation of data in a file 
or files and documents on a computer. Though everybody has an understanding of the term file, we 
present a formal definition anyway: 
<br><br>
A file or a computer file is a chunk of logically related data or information which can be used by 
computer programs. Usually a file is kept on a permanent storage media, e.g. a hard drive disk. 
A unique name and path is used by human users or in programs or scripts to access a file 
for reading and modification purposes.
<br><br>
The term "file" - as we have described it in the previous paragraph - appeared in the history of computers 
very early. Usage can be tracked down to the year 1952, when punch cards where used.
<br><br>  
A programming language without the capability to store and retrieve previously stored 
information would be hardly useful. 
<br><br>
The most basic tasks involved in file manipulation are reading data from files and 
writing or appending data to files. 
<br><br>
<h3>Reading and Writing Files in Python</h3>
The syntax for reading and writing files in Python is similar to programming languages like C, 
C++, Java, Perl, and others but a lot easier to handle.
<br><br>
In our first example we want to show how to read data from a file. The way of telling Python
that we want to read from a file is to use the open  function. The first parameter is the name 
of the file we want to read and with the second parameter, assigned to the value "r", we state
that we want to read from the file:
<br>
<pre>
fobj = open("ad_lesbiam.txt", "r")
</pre>
The "r" is optional. An open() command with just a file name is opened for reading per default.
The open() function returns a file object, which offers attributes and methods. 
<br>
<pre>
fobj = open("ad_lesbiam.txt")
</pre>

After we have finished working with a file, we have to close it again by using the 
file object method close():
<br>
<pre>
fobj.close()
</pre>
<br>Now we want to finally open and read a file. The method rstrip() in the following example is
used to strip off whitespaces (newlines included) from the right side of the string "line":
<br>
<pre>
fobj = open("ad_lesbiam.txt")
for line in fobj:
    print(line.rstrip())
fobj.close()
</pre>
<br>
If we save this script and call it, we get the following output, provided that the text file "ad_lesbiam.txt" is available:
<br>
<pre>
$ python file_read.py 
V. ad Lesbiam

VIVAMUS mea Lesbia, atque amemus,
rumoresque senum severiorum
omnes unius aestimemus assis!
soles occidere et redire possunt:
nobis cum semel occidit breuis lux,
nox est perpetua una dormienda.
da mi basia mille, deinde centum,
dein mille altera, dein secunda centum,
deinde usque altera mille, deinde centum.
dein, cum milia multa fecerimus,
conturbabimus illa, ne sciamus,
aut ne quis malus inuidere possit,
cum tantum sciat esse basiorum.
(GAIUS VALERIUS CATULLUS)
</pre>
By the way, the poem above is a love poem of the ancient Roman poet Catull, who was hopelessly in love 
with a woman called Lesbia. 
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Write into a File</h3>
<p>
Writing to a file is as easy as reading from a file. To open a file for writing
we set the second parameter to "w" instead of "r". To actually write the data
into this file, we use the method write() of the file handle object. 
<br><br>
Let's start with a very simple and straightforward example:
<br>
<pre>
fh = open("example.txt", "w")
fh.write("To write or not to write\nthat is the question!\n")
fh.close()
</pre>

Especially if you are writing to a file, you should never forget to close the 
file handle again. Otherwise you will risk to end up in a non consistent state of your
data.
<br><br>
You will often find the with statement for reading and writing files. The 
advantage is that the file will be automatically closed after the indented
block after the with has finished execution:
<br>
<pre>
with open("example.txt", "w") as fh:
    fh.write("To write or not to write\nthat is the question!\n")
</pre>

<br><br>
Our first example can also be rewritten like this with the with statement:
<pre>
with open("ad_lesbiam.txt") as fobj:
    for line in fobj:
        print(line.rstrip())
</pre>



<br>Example for simultaneously reading and writing:
<br>
<pre>
fobj_in = open("ad_lesbiam.txt")
fobj_out = open("ad_lesbiam2.txt","w")
i = 1
for line in fobj_in:
    print(line.rstrip())
    fobj_out.write(str(i) + ": " + line)
    i = i + 1
fobj_in.close()
fobj_out.close()
</pre>
</p>
Every line of the input text file is prefixed by its line number. So the result looks 
like this:
<pre>
$ more ad_lesbiam2.txt 
1: V. ad Lesbiam 
2: 
3: VIVAMUS mea Lesbia, atque amemus,
4: rumoresque senum severiorum
5: omnes unius aestimemus assis!
6: soles occidere et redire possunt:
7: nobis cum semel occidit breuis lux,
8: nox est perpetua una dormienda.
9: da mi basia mille, deinde centum,
10: dein mille altera, dein secunda centum,
11: deinde usque altera mille, deinde centum.
12: dein, cum milia multa fecerimus,
13: conturbabimus illa, ne sciamus,
14: aut ne quis malus inuidere possit,
15: cum tantum sciat esse basiorum.
16: (GAIUS VALERIUS CATULLUS)
</pre>

There is one possible problem, which we have to point out: What happens if we open a file for writing, 
and this file already exists. You can consider yourself fortunate, if the content of this file was of
no importance, or if you have a backup of it. Otherwise you have a problem, because as soon as an open()
with a "w" has been executed the file will be removed. This is often what you want, but sometimes you just
want to append to the file, like it's the case with logfiles.
<br><br>
If you want to append something to an existing file, you have to use "a" instead of "w".
<br><br>
<h3>Reading in one go</h3>
So far we worked on files line by line by using a for loop. Very often, especially if the file is not
too large, it's more convenient to read the file into a complete data structure, e.g. a string or a list.
The file can be closed after reading and the work is accomplished on this data structure:
<pre>
>>> poem = open("ad_lesbiam.txt").readlines()
>>> print(poem)
['V. ad Lesbiam \n', '\n', 'VIVAMUS mea Lesbia, atque amemus,\n', 'rumoresque senum severiorum\n', 'omnes unius aestimemus assis!\n', 'soles occidere et redire possunt:\n', 'nobis cum semel occidit breuis lux,\n', 'nox est perpetua una dormienda.\n', 'da mi basia mille, deinde centum,\n', 'dein mille altera, dein secunda centum,\n', 'deinde usque altera mille, deinde centum.\n', 'dein, cum milia multa fecerimus,\n', 'conturbabimus illa, ne sciamus,\n', 'aut ne quis malus inuidere possit,\n', 'cum tantum sciat esse basiorum.\n', '(GAIUS VALERIUS CATULLUS)']
>>> print(poem[2])
VIVAMUS mea Lesbia, atque amemus,
</pre>
In the above example, the complete poem is read into the list poem. We can acces e.g. the 3rd line with
<code>poem[2]</code>.
<br><br>
Another convenient way to read in a file might be the method read() of open. With this method we can read the 
complete file into a string, as we can see in the next example:
<pre>
>>> poem = open("ad_lesbiam.txt").read()
>>> print(poem[16:34])
VIVAMUS mea Lesbia
>>> type(poem)
&lt;type 'str'&gt;
>>> 
</pre>

This string contains the complete content of the file, which includes the carriage returns and line feeds.
<br><br>

<h3>Resetting the Files Current Position</h3>

It's possible to set - or reset - a file's position to a certain position, also called the offset. 
To do this, we use the method seek. It has only one parameter in Python3 (no "whence" is availabe as in Python2). 
The parameter of seek determines the offset which we want to set the current position to. To work with seek, 
we will often need the method tell, which "tells" us the current position. When we have just opened a file, 
it will be zero. We will demonstrate the way of working with both seek and tell in the following example. 
You have to create a file called "buck_mulligan.txt" with the content "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came 
from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.":

<pre>
>>> fh = open("buck_mulligan.txt")
>>> fh.tell()
0
>>> fh.read(7)
'Stately'
>>> fh.tell()
7
>>> fh.read()
', plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of\nlather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.\n'
>>> fh.tell()
122
>>> fh.seek(9)
9
>>> fh.read(5)
'plump'
</pre>

It's also possible to set the file position relative to the current position by using tell correspondingly:

<pre>
>>> fh = open("buck_mulligan.txt")
>>> fh.read(15)
'Stately, plump '
>>> # set the current position 6 characters to the left:
... 
>>> fh.seek(fh.tell() -6)
9
>>> fh.read(5)
'plump'
>>> # now, we will advance 29 characters to the  
>>> # 'right' relative to the current position:
...
>>> fh.seek(fh.tell() + 29)
43
>>> fh.read(10)
'stairhead,'
>>> 
</pre>

<br><br>

<h3>"How to get into a Pickle"</h3>
<p>
<img class="imgright" src="images/pickle.png" alt="Pickle" />
We don't mean what the heading says. On the contrary, we want to prevent any nasty situation, like
loosing the data, which your Python program has calculated. So, we will show you, how you can save 
your data in an easy way, that you or better your programm can reread them at a later date again. 
We are "pickling" the data, so that nothing gets lost.
<br><br>
Python offers for this purpose a module, which is called "pickle"
With the algorithms of the pickle module we can serialize and de-serialize Python object structures. 
"Pickling" denotes the process which converts a Python object hierarchy into a byte stream, 
and "unpickling" on the other hand is the inverse operation, i.e. the byte stream is converted back 
into an object hierarchy. What we call pickling (and unpickling) is also known as "serialization" 
or "flattening" a data structure.
<br><br>
An object can be dumped with the dump method of the pickle module:
<pre>
pickle.dump(obj, file[,protocol, *, fix_imports=True])
</pre>
dump() writes a pickled representation of obj to the open file object file. The optional protocol 
argument tells the pickler to use the given protocol:
<ul>
<li>Protocol version 0 is the original (before Python3) human-readable (ascii) protocol
 and is backwards compatible with previous versions of Python
</li>
<li>Protocol version 1 is the old binary format which is also compatible with previous 
versions of Python.</li>
<li>Protocol version 2 was introduced in Python 2.3. It provides much more efficient 
pickling of new-style classes.</li>
<li>Protocol version 3 was introduced with Python 3.0. 
It has explicit support for bytes and cannot be unpickled by Python 2.x pickle modules. 
It's the recommended protocol of Python 3.x.</li>

</ul>
The default protocol of Python3 is 3.  
<br><br>
If <i>fix_imports</li> is True and protocol is less than 3, pickle will try to map the 
new Python3 names to the old module names used in Python2, so that the pickle data stream 
is readable with Python 2.
 
<br><br>
Objects which have been dumped to a file with <b>pickle.dump</b> can be reread into a program
by using the method pickle.load(file). pickle.load recognizes automatically, which format
had been used for writing the data.
<br>
A simple example:<br>
<pre>
>>> cities = ["Paris", "Dijon","Lyon","Strasbourg"]
>>> fh = open("data.pkl","bw")
>>> pickle.dump(cities,fh)
>>> fh.close()
</pre>

The file data.pkl can be read in again by Python in the same or another session or 
by a different program:

<pre>
>>> import pickle
>>> f = open("data.pkl","rb")
>>> villes = pickle.load(f)
>>> print(villes)
['Paris', 'Dijon', 'Lyon', 'Strasbourg']
>>>
</pre>
Only the objects and not their names are saved. That's why we use the assignment to villes in the 
previous example, i.e.data = pickle.load(f).
<br><br>

In our previous example, we had pickled only one object, i.e. a list of French cities. But what about 
pickling multiple objects? The solution is easy: We pack the objects into another object, so we will 
only have to pickle one object again. We will pack two lists "programming_languages" and "python_dialects"
into a list pickle_objects in the following example:


<pre>
>>> import pickle
>>> fh = open("data.pkl","bw")
>>> programming_languages = ["Python", "Perl", "C++", "Java", "Lisp"]
>>> python_dialects = ["Jython", "IronPython", "CPython"]
>>> pickle_object = (programming_languages, python_dialects)
>>> pickle.dump(pickle_object,fh)
>>> fh.close()
</pre>

Obige gepickelte Datei kÃ¶nnen wir so einlesen, dass wir die beiden Listen wieder trennen kÃ¶nnen:

<pre>
>>> import pickle
>>> f = open("data.pkl","rb")
>>> (languages, dialects) = pickle.load(f)
>>> print(languages, dialects)
['Python', 'Perl', 'C++', 'Java', 'Lisp'] ['Jython', 'IronPython', 'CPython']
>>> 
</pre>

<br><br>
<h3>shelve Module</h3>

One drawback of the pickle module is, that it is only capable of pickling one object at the time, which
has to be unpickled in one go. Let's imagine this data object is a dictionary. It may be desirable, that
we don't have to save and load every time the whole dictionary, but save and load just a single value 
corresponding to just one key. The shelve module is the solution to this request. A "shelf" - as used in the
shelve module - is a persistent, dictionary-like object.  The difference with dbm databases is that the 
values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be essentially arbitrary Python objects -- anything that the "pickle"
module can handle.  This includes most class instances, recursive data types, and objects containing 
lots of shared sub-objects.  The keys have to be strings.
<br><br>
The shelve module can be easily used. Actually, it is as easy as using a dictionay in Python. Before we
can use a shelf object, we have to import the module. After this, we have to open a shelve object with the shelve method
open. The open method opens a special shelf file for reading and writing: 
<br><br>
<pre>
>>> import shelve
>>> s = shelve.open("MyShelve")
</pre>
<br><br>
If the file "MyShelve" already exists, the open method will try to open it. If it isn't a shelf file, - i.e. a file
which has been created with the shelve module, - we will get an error message. 
If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.
<br><br>
We can use s like an ordinary dictionary, if we use strings as keys:
<br><br>
<pre>
>>> s["street"] = "Fleet Str"
>>> s["city"] = "London"
>>> for key in s:
...     print(key)
... 
city
street
</pre>
<br><br>

A shelf object has to be closed with the close method:
<br><br>
<pre>
>>> s.close()
</pre>
<br><br>
We can use the previously created shelf file in another program or in an interactive Python session:
<br><br>
<pre>
$ python3
Python 3.2.3 (default, Feb 28 2014, 00:22:33) 
[GCC 4.7.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import shelve
>>> s = shelve.open("MyShelve")
>>> s["street"]
'Fleet Str'
>>> s["city"]
'London'
>>> 
</pre>
<br><br>
It is also possible to cast a shelf object into an "ordinary" dictionary with the dict function:
<br><br>
<pre>
>>> s
&le;shelve.DbfilenameShelf object at 0xb7133dcc&gt;
>>> dict(s)
{'city': 'London', 'street': 'Fleet Str'}
>>> 
</pre>
<br><br>
The following example uses more complex values for our shelf object:
<br><br>
<pre>
>>> import shelve
>>> tele = shelve.open("MyPhoneBook")
>>> tele["Mike"] = {"first":"Mike", "last":"Miller", "phone":"4689"}
>>> tele["Steve"] = {"first":"Stephan", "last":"Burns", "phone":"8745"}
>>> tele["Eve"] = {"first":"Eve", "last":"Naomi", "phone":"9069"}
>>> tele["Eve"]["phone"]
'9069'
</pre>
<br><br>
The data is persistent!

To demonstrate this once more, we reopen our MyPhoneBook:
<pre>
$ python3
Python 3.2.3 (default, Feb 28 2014, 00:22:33) 
[GCC 4.7.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import shelve
>>> tele = shelve.open("MyPhoneBook")
>>> tele["Steve"]["phone"]
'8745'
>>> 

</pre>
