<h1>First steps in MySQL</h1>


<p>
In this chapter, we are going to make our first steps with MySQL. We will
start the server, connect to the server with a client tool, create a new
user and issue our first SQL statements. 
</p>

<h2 id="startstop">Starting/stopping the MySQL server</h2>

<p>
MySQL server is a daemon which runs in the background. The way you start 
MySQL depends on your system and the installation type that you have done. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld start
$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld stop
</pre>

<p>
On traditional init based systems, we would use the above commands to start 
and stop the MySQL server.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ sudo service mysql start
$ sudo service mysql stop
</pre>

<p>
Ubuntu Linux has migrated to Upstart, which is an event based daemon used for starting
tasks and services and supervising them. On systems that use Upstart, we would start
and stop MySQL server using the above commands. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ su
Password: 
# /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe &amp;
# exit
exit
$ 
</pre>

<p>
The final option is to start and stop MySQL server manually. If you have followed this
tutorial from the beginning and have installed the MySQL from sources, this is the
way to go. The mysqld_safe script starts the MySQL server. <!--Note the full path. Despite
the fact that the directory containing mysqld_safe script is inside the PATH variable, 
we need to specify the full path. On some systems we might not need to specify the full
path. It depends on the way sudo command was built. On Ubuntu, the sudo command shortens
the PATH and takes only a limited group of directories into account. -->
First we change to the root account and then we start the script. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ sudo passwd root
Enter new UNIX password: 
Retype new UNIX password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
$ su root
Password: 
root@spartan:/usr/local/mysql# 
</pre>

<p>
On Ubuntu, the root account is not enabled by default. Here we show, how to enable it.
Then we can use the <code>su</code> (switch user) command to switch to root to start 
the MySQL daemon. 
</p>

<p>
After we have started the server, we can check if it is alive.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ mysqladmin -uroot -p ping
Enter password: 
mysqld is alive
</pre>

<p>
We use the <code>mysqladmin</code> tool to check if MySQL server 
is running. The <code>-u</code> option specifies the user which 
pings the server. The <code>-p</code> option is a password for the 
user. If the password is omitted, the <code>mysqladmin</code> prompts 
for one. The characters that you type after the prompt are not visible. 
This is a more secure solution for working with <code>mysqladmin</code>. 
This way no one behind your back can see the password you have typed 
and it is not stored in the history of the shell. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ mysqladmin -uroot -p shutdown
</pre>

<p>
We use the <code>mysqladmin</code> tool to shut down the MySQL server. 
</p>


<h2 id="connect">Connecting to the MySQL server</h2>

<p>
The <code>mysql</code> is a MySQL command line tool. It is a simple shell. 
It supports interactive and non-interactive use. It is located in the 
<code>/usr/local/mysql/bin</code> directory. (On our installation.)
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ mysql -uroot -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 1
Server version: 5.5.9 Source distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql> 
</pre>

<p>
We connect to the server with the <code>mysql</code> tool. Note that we have 
omitted the password after the <code>-p</code> option. We type the password 
after the <samp>'Enter password'</samp> prompt.
</p>

<p>
The <code>mysql</code> command line tool has mysql> as prompt. At this prompt 
we can issue both <code>mysql</code> built-in commands and SQL statements. 
We need to familiarise ourselves with the <code>mysql</code> tool. 
The <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> clears the screen, the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> 
or the <code>quit</code> command quit 
the <code>mysql</code>. We need to distinguish between <code>mysql</code> 
commands and SQL statements. SQL statements are terminated with a semicolon.
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> help

notee     (\t) Don't write into outfile.
pager     (\P) Set PAGER [to_pager]. Print the query results via PAGER.
print     (\p) Print current command.
prompt    (\R) Change your mysql prompt.
quit      (\q) Quit mysql.
...
</pre>

<p>
Type help to get a full list of <code>mysql</code> commands. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> system pwd
/home/vronskij/programming/mysql
</pre>

<p>
The <code>system</code> command can execute a shell command. We have launched 
the <code>pwd</code> command to find out our current working directory. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> quit
Bye
</pre>

<p>
The <code>quit</code> command terminates the <code>mysql</code> shell. 
</p>


<h2 id="database">Creating a database</h2>

<p>
Now we are going to create our database. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| test               |
+--------------------+
</pre>

<p>
The <code>SHOW DATABASES</code> statement shows all available databases on our
system. Note that SQL statements are terminated with a semicolon. There are four
databases present. The <code>information_schema</code>, <code>mysql</code>, 
and <code>performance_schema</code> are MySQL system databases. The <code>test</code> 
database is available as a workspace for users to try things out. It is empty; 
there are no tables. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> CREATE DATABASE mydb;
</pre>

<p>
This statement creates a new database. Throughout this tutorial, we will use the 
<code>mydb</code> database. To create a new database, we need to have certain 
privileges. Remember that we have connected to the server with the root user, which 
is a superuser and has all privileges.
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mydb               |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| test               |
+--------------------+
</pre>

<p>
Showing all databases, the <code>mydb</code> database is among them. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> use mydb;
Database changed
</pre>

<p>
In order to work with a database, we must first select it. 
We select a specific database with a use command. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
</pre>

<p>
The <code>SHOW TABLES</code> statement shows all available tables in 
a database. Since it is a newly created database, no tables are found. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> source cars.sql
Database changed
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.20 sec)

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.08 sec)

...
</pre>

<p>
In the first chapter, we have provided some SQL scripts to create
some tables. We use the source command to execute the <code>cars.sql</code> 
script, which creates a <code>Cars</code> table for us.
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
+----------------+
| Tables_in_mydb |
+----------------+
| Cars           |
+----------------+
</pre>

<p>
Now the <code>SHOW TABLES</code> statement displays one table available. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> SELECT * FROM Cars;
+----+------------+--------+
| Id | Name       | Cost   |
+----+------------+--------+
|  1 | Audi       |  52642 |
|  2 | Mercedes   |  57127 |
|  3 | Skoda      |   9000 |
|  4 | Volvo      |  29000 |
|  5 | Bentley    | 350000 |
|  6 | Citroen    |  21000 |
|  7 | Hummer     |  41400 |
|  8 | Volkswagen |  21600 |
+----+------------+--------+
</pre>

<p>
And this is the data in the table. 
</p>


<h2 id="user">Creating a new user</h2>

<p>
Similarly to Unix root account, it is advised not to use the MySQL
superuser root account for our tasks. We should use the root
account only when it is necessary. We rather create a new account
that we will use for our tasks. This user will have limited privileges. 
When using the root user we could accidentally do a lot of harm to
our data. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> CREATE USER user12@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '34klq*';
</pre>

<p>
The above statement created a new user called <code>user12</code>. 
The accout has password <code>34klq*</code>. The user is created, 
but he has no privileges. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
mysql> GRANT ALL ON mydb.* to user12@localhost;
</pre>

<p>
This statement grants all privileges to <code>user12</code> for all database 
objects on the <code>mydb</code> database. These privileges will be sufficient 
for the examples in this tutorial.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, we did our first steps with MySQL database system.
